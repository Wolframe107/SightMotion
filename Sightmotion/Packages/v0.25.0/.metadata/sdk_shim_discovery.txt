# These variables should be provided by the client:
#  MLSDK:          full path to current Lumin SDK
#  HOST:           win64, osx, linux64
#  MLSDK_VERSION:  the "version" attribute from sdk.manifest
#
# Then the client should parse this file, gather variables,
# and substitute the values from the variables above and other
# variables defined in this file in order to resolve them.
#
# (Further explicit documentation will be provided to integrators.)

# This is where stub shared libraries live (link-time).  All stub implementations
# return MLResult_NotImplemented except for ml_privileges and ml_platform.

STUB_PATH=$(MLSDK)/lib/$(HOST)

# Under ZI, a subset of the shared libraries are reimplemented
# for zero iteration.  The client should not make assumptions about which
# ones these are.  It should load all the required Lumin SDK libraries
# according to the path below, which favors ZI implementations over
# the stub implementations.

# A client should ensure that PATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, or LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# are configured such that the following paths are searched left-to-right
# for SDK shim shared libraries when running an app under zero iteration.
