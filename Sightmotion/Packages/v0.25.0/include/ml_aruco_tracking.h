  \brief APIs for the ArUco Tracker system.

  This tracker is used to track square fiducial markers (also known as Augmented Reality Markers).
  It allows for rendering virtual content in relation to the location of so called ArUco
  markers that can be attached to flat surfaces. Each ArUco marker has a unique ID,
  so different markers can be tracked at the same time and are distinguishable as long as they
  belong to the same dictionary and have the same size.

  \attention Our ArUco detector sometimes detects false positives, so markers where there aren't any in the real world.
  This will lead to an entry in the #MLArucoTrackerResultArray that should better be ignored. There are two approaches
  to handle false positives in the results:
  1. False positives are rarely tracked over time. By checking whether an ArUco marker has been detected in a previous
  frame already, you can distinguish a random false detection from an actual detection. Applying this filtering method
  is useful if markers are stationary and the speed of detection is not very important. That's because one has to wait
  for up-coming results to make sure the marker has been detected robustly.
  2. 6DOF poses of false positives are usually far away or otherwise unusual. By comparing the detected pose with your
  current head pose you can determine if a detction was likely or maybe even impossible. This method is helpful if you
  can make assumptions on where markers are going to be, what IDs they will have and whether the camera is even able to
  detect a marker that is as far away as it is reported.
