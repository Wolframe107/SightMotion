  \brief Set surface hint on decoder.

  Note that MLMediaCodecSetSurfaceHint *has* to be called before MLMediaCodecConfigure
  or else, behavior will default to MLMediaCodecSurfaceHint_Hardware.

  If surface_hint is set to 'MLMediaCodecSurfaceHint_Hardware', codec will try to create
  an internal native hardware surface onto which frames will be directly decoded (zero-copy
  fast path). In that case, calls to MLMediaCodecGetOutputBufferPointer() will return NULL for
  out_buffer_ptr and 0 for out_buffer_size, since decoded buffers will be residing in GPU memory.
  (note: Only true if codec was correctly configured with an available Hardware decoder on
  the system, otherwise, decoder will be software and MLMediaCodecGetOutputBufferPointer() will
  return CPU-allocated buffer pointer and size). When using MLMediaCodecSurfaceHint_Hardware with
  any Hardware Decoder, dequeued output buffers need to be "rendered" onto the internal native surface
  by setting 'render' = true when calling MLMediaCodecReleaseOutputBuffer() and then, rendered frame
  can be retrieved in the form of a native buffer handle by calling MLMediaCodecAcquireNextAvailableFrame().
  This handle points to an android native buffer and can for example be bound as an external texture
  with OpenGLES.

  If surface_hint is set to MLMediaCodecSurfaceHint_Software, Codec will allocate an internal
  buffer on CPU memory onto which decoded buffers will be copied (slow path). In that case,
  note that there is no need to "render" the output buffer when releasing it. To access
  decoded pixels, call MLMediaCodecGetOutputBufferPointer() on the buffer handle and
  out_buffer_ptr and out_buffer_size will return the correct pointer to data and frame size.
  Note this mode of operation is very slow and is generally intended for callers with no access
  to a compliant graphics library or with very specific needs.

  \brief Create an input surface for a hardware encoder

  Requests an input surface to use as the input to an encoder, in place of input buffers.

  This API must only be called after MLMediaCodecConfigure() and before MLMediaCodecStart()
  otherwise the operation will fail and an input surface cannot be created.

  An input surface allows video consumers, such as a video encoder, to process raw input video
  buffers natively. The input surface is intended to act as a destination surface for your input data.

  When using an input surface, there are no accessible input buffers, as buffers are automatically
  passed from the input surface to the codec. In synchronous mode, calling MLMediaCodecDequeueInputBuffer()
  will return MLMediaGenericResult_InvalidOperation. In asynchronous mode, the client will not be
  notified when an input buffer is available (i.e. the on_input_buffer_available callback will not fire).

  The returned input surface can be passed as a destination surface to a decoder when calling
  MLMediaCodecConfigureWithSurface(). Decoded output of the decoder can be consumed direclty as input
  to an encoder without copying. This allows implementation of fast, zero-copy transcoding.

  The returned input surface can also be passed as a destination surface to
    - a video capture session when calling MLCameraPrepareCaptureEx().
    - a mixed reality video capture session when calling MLMRCameraPrepareCapture().
  Captured raw video frames will be consumed directly as input to an encoder without copying.

  The user of this API is responsible for calling #MLMediaCodecReleaseSurface() on the Surface when done.
