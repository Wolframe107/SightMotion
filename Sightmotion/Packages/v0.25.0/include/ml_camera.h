  \brief Start video capture and provide raw frames through callback

  The captured video YUV frames will be returned to the application via on_video_buffer_available.
  The current supported video resolution is 1080p.

  If this function is invoked before the camera sensor has locked AE and AWB,
  it will be blocked till AE,AWB is locked and then starts to capture.

  MLCameraCaptureVideoStop() needs to be called to stop the capture.
