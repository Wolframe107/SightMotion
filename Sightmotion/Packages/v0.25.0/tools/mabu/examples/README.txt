This directory contains examples of mabu project files, indicating which
settings are available for particular kinds of projects or usages.
None of these are expected to build and only serve as documentation.

See https://developer.magicleap.com/learn/guides/magic-leap-builder-user-guide
for notes on converting existing projects to mabu, and for references to
other documentation.
